# DesignPatterns
 ## Creational
 ## Structural
- **Decorator** - attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

 ## Behavioral
- **Strategy** - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- **Observer** - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

# SOLID
 ## Single Responsibility
 - Decorator
 ## Open for Extension / Closed for Modification
 - Strategy
 - Observer
 - Decorator
 ## Liskov Substitution
 ## Interface Segregation
 ## Dependency Inversion

# OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritence
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
